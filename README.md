# *Qetsia's Dream Travel Destinations*

Submitted by: **Qetsia Nkulu**

**Dream Travel Destinations** is a simple catalog webpage that shows various travel destinations that I would like to visit one day. 
The UI is inpsired by the [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) homepage.

Time spent: **10+** hours spent in total

## Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can add new entries to the site 
- [x] User can delete entries
- [x] User can filter destinations by continents 
- [x] User can see destinations of multiple continents at once 


## Known Bugs
- If a continent is selected, deleting all the entries associated with that continent crashes the webpage 
- When new entry is added, it does not appear when selecting the continent filter (i.e. creating en entry for Tokyo, Japan, Asia does not appear when 'Asia' filter is selected)

## Potential Features 
- Adding an 'Edit' button that allows users to edit an entry and modify the car image 
- Add a filter for parks
